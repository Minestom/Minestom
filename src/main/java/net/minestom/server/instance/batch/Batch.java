/**
 * A Batch is a tool used to cache a list of block changes, and apply the changes whenever you want.
 * <p>
 * Batches offer a performance benefit because clients are not notified of any change until all of
 * the blocks have been placed, and because changes can happen with less synchronization.
 * <p>
 * All batches may be rotated using {link}, however rotate operations do not mutate the batch, so the
 * result should be cached if used multiple times.
 * <p>
 * If reversal is a desired behavior, batches may be applied in "reversal mode" using {link}. This
 * operation will return a new batch with the blocks set to whatever they were before the batch was
 * applied.
 *
 * @param <C> The callback function type.
