A [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) fork that tries to add missing features and cutting edge PR requests straight from the original repository.

This is a developer API not meant to be used by end-users. Replacing Bukkit/Forge/Sponge with this **will not work** since we do not implement any of their APIs.

# Why Sakura Minestom?
Minestom is a great project with great contributors, however, it doesn't seem to evolve quickly enough resulting in missing features that are necessary for a production ready environment.
The purpose of this fork is to provide as many fixes and features as quickly as possible without waiting for the official repository maintainers to merge PRs.
Any time an interesting or useful, ready and possibly ready-for-production PR is made it will be merged here.

While this may bring noticeable advantages such as missing features over the original project, its "fast-paced" nature may introduce more bugs or unexpected behaviors despite all the effort that could be put to ensure proper unit-testing and in-game testing.
