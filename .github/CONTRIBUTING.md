## How to contribute to Sakura Minestom
#### **Did you find a bug?**
* Open a new GitHub issue if it's not already reported.

* Explain it clearly, with steps (or code) to reproduce it. 

#### **Did you write some code that fixes a bug?**
* Open a new GitHub pull-request with the commits if it hasn't already been proposed.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
* If your feature is not strictly related to Sakura Minestom then I'd rather you open a PR in the [original Minestom repository](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom/) and then eventually opening the same PR here. Ideally this project shouldn't steer too much from the original repo and any noteworthy feature should be added there first, please note you need to contact collaborators there before making a PR, you don't need to do so to open a PR here, just open it and if it's good it will be merged.
